# Insights — GPU Market Signal Tracker (Week 1)

## What I built
I built a lightweight Python pipeline that ingests GPU-related headlines from public RSS feeds and classifies them into business-relevant themes.

## Why I built it
GPU and AI news is high volume and unstructured. This project turns scattered headlines into structured signals so trends are easier to spot.

## What this outputs
- A structured CSV of tagged headlines
- A simple visualization showing theme frequency

## What I expect to observe
- Data-center and AI-related headlines dominate over consumer GPU news
- Product launches appear in clusters
- Regulation-related mentions are fewer but high impact

## Next improvements
- Add source weighting
- Introduce sentiment scoring
- Track week-over-week changes
